Hi, I'm Oleksandr, a software engineer based in Helsinki.

In my daily work I mostly use Swift, Ruby and Objective-C, and draw inspiration from functional languages like Haskell and Lisp.

My passion lies in learning about the world around through the prism of technology.
In my free time, I study and expertiment with Computer Vision and Computer Graphics using Python and C++.

This blog is where I share the things I find curious, challenging, or just plain fun.

Enjoy the ride!
