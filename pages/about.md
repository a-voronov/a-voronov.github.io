Hi, I'm Oleksandr - a software engineer, passionate about exploring the world through the lens of technology.

In my daily work, I mostly use Swift, Ruby, and Objective-C, drawing inspiration from functional languages like Haskell and Lisp.
I enjoy building tools and engines that support robust, maintainable software - with developer experience in mind.
Lately, Iâ€™ve been focusing on Computer Vision and Computer Graphics, working with Python and C++.

Away from the screen, I find joy in tinkering with FPV drones, photography, spending time in nature, and staying active through various sports - all of which help me unwind.

This blog is where I share the things I find curious, challenging, or just plain fun.

Enjoy the ride!
