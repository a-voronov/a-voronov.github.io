Hi, I'm Oleksandr, a software engineer based in Helsinki.

In my daily work I develop mobile apps and sometimes - backend.
I primarily work with Swift, Ruby, with some Objective-C, and I often draw ideas from functional languages like Haskell and Lisp.

My passion lies in learning about the world around through the prism of technology.
In my free time I'm studying and practicing Computer Vision and Computer Graphics with Python and C++.

This blog is where I share the things I find curious, challenging, or just plain fun.

Enjoy the ride!
